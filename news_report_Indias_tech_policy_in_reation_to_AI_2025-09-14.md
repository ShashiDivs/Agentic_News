## Section 2: Summaries
1. A report by IBM has shown that nearly 60% of Indian organizations either do not have an AI governance policy in place or are in the process of developing one. This report highlights the growing concern regarding the security measures needed to address potential AI-related cyber threats amid rapid AI adoption. The average cost of data breaches in India has reached INR 220 million in 2025, increasing by 13% from the previous year. The report indicates only 37% of surveyed organizations have implemented AI access controls, with a significant gap in safeguards against unauthorized AI use. Phishing remains the primary cause of data breaches in India, while the cost of breaches can be exacerbated by the widespread use of 'shadow AI.' - The Hindu

2. India's IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has outlined the country's AI strategy, which focuses on democratizing technology and creating jobs. Emphasizing initiatives like IndiaAI, AIKosh, and Bhashini, the government aims to develop accessible datasets and support innovation across sectors. India ranks among the top nations in AI capabilities and contributes significantly to global AI projects. As the digital sector grows, anticipated revenues from technology are expected to top $280 billion. The strategy also aims to enhance skills and build India's AI ecosystem while ensuring ethical governance as AI usage expands. - Economic Times

3. India has launched an AI Competency Framework with the goal of enhancing the skills of its civil servants for effective governance. This initiative aligns with UNESCO's global vision for ethical AI implementation in the public sector. The framework focuses on role-specific competencies across various levels of governance, emphasizing critical areas like AI literacy and ethical considerations. The initiative reflects India’s commitment to integrating AI into public administration effectively while ensuring that technological developments address public service needs and uphold fundamental rights. - UNESCO

4. India currently lacks a dedicated AI regulation framework, using existing laws to address AI-related challenges. The Information Technology Act, Digital Personal Data Protection Act, and various policy guidelines offer some regulatory coverage. Despite the absence of comprehensive AI laws, recent initiatives such as the Digital India Act aim to create a structured approach toward AI governance. Experts emphasize the need for a holistic review to craft effective regulations addressing ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and job displacement as AI technologies evolve. - News18

5. India's strategy for AI autonomy is defined by a three-pillar approach: democratizing AI through open innovation, developing public-sector led applications to address critical needs, and leading global efforts toward sustainable development through AI. The country emphasizes creating open-source AI solutions that cater to its diverse challenges, such as healthcare, education, and agriculture. By fostering a robust ecosystem of startups and integrating AI technologies into public services, India aims to address socio-economic disparities while positioning itself as a global AI leader. - Atlantic Council
